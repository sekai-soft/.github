We are [Sekaisoft](https://sekaisoft.tech/).

We envision a world where software, the web, and software company is more ethical.

We hence build "ethical-ware" in the open here. Ethical-ware promotes longevity, user agency, and free flow of information.

Our software philosophy:
- Find balance between idealism and pragmatism.
- Design for longevity.
- Build on existing standards, protocols and platforms.
- Keep it simple and stupid.
- Dog-food your own software.
